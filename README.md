# Sprint 2 - The Design Brief

Today you will for the first time work on a real design brief, your goal for today is to please the designer by copying the design as close as you can. When doing this you will also learn the basics of React and how to setup and run your first React app. 

Also, remember that designers are picky, we expect all distances, sizes, colors and fonts to be as in the brief.

## How to complete this assignment

You will complete this assignment when your version looks the same as the design brief for desktop and mobile. We expect colors, fonts, sizes and differences to match. If they are not specified, do your best to come as close as possible. 

### Setup React

What's needed from Damien: 
How to set things up and where they should write their code. Also how they compile and look at their code. 

### Brief and Assets

In the `assets`folder are all assets you need to complete this assigmment. The font used in the design is [link to font]. 

To complete this assignment, you need to fork this repository, add your code in the "code" folder, and then submit a pull request on GitHub (from your repository into the technigo one) for review. Read the guide on GitHub for more info on how to do this.

Good luck!

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language your're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies in your Company.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask Damien. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

### :boom: Success!

After completing this assignment you should be comfortable into setting up an React app and write static JSX to build web pages. You should also be comfortable in compiling React code and viewing the result in your browser.
